# 👋 Hi, I'm Azim Darmon

💻 **Full-Stack Developer | Backend Engineer | Open-Source Enthusiast**

I’m passionate about **open-source development** and the art of building things that scale.  
Right now, my main technical focus is on:

- **Full-Stack Development** — Crafting rich, modern web apps with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
- **Backend Engineering** — Designing high-performance APIs and distributed systems using FastAPI, Spring Boot, Django, and Node.js.
- **Scalable & Distributed Systems** — Building resilient, message-driven architectures powered by Celery, RabbitMQ, Redis, and AWS.
- **AI Research & Applied Intelligence** — Gradually moving toward intelligent systems, embeddings, and LLM-powered products.

My **career goal** is simple (but ambitious):  
> ⚡ *To become the most cracked software engineer alive.*
